# `Mapping_Earthquakes Challenge`


 ## `Project Overview ` <br/>
The purpose of Mapping_Earthquakesproject is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
I used the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude has a larger diameter and is darker in color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. <br/>
#### `Resources`
•	Data Source: [Google]( Google) . <br/> 
•	Software: JavaScript, HTML, GeoJSON, D3.js library , Leaflet library ,Git Bash, GitHub.

## `Summary`


1.	In the Deliverable 1 the tectonic plate data was added as a second layer group and also was added to the overlay object. We can see earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth on the map  below:

2.	In the Deliverable 2 the major earthquake data was added as a third layer group and also was added to the overlay object. We can see earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map below:

3.	 In the Deliverable 3 a third map style was added to earthquake map. For third style I decided to use Navigation preview style. This style is designed for previewing a navigation route. There are two styles available: day and night. Mapbox does not give these styles their own standalone products page but does reference them in the Mapbox GL JS docs.
